Description: Provides statistical methods for network meta-analysis 
    of 1â€“5 diagnostic tests to simultaneously compare multiple tests within a 
    missing data framework, including:
    - Bayesian hierarchical model for network meta-analysis of multiple 
      diagnostic tests 
      (Ma, Lian, Chu, Ibrahim, and Chen (2018) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxx025>)
    - Bayesian Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic Model 
      for Network Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Tests 
      (Lian, Hodges, and Chu (2019) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1476239>).

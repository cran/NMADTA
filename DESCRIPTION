Description: Implements HSROC (hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic) model developed by Ma, Lian, Chu, Ibrahim, and Chen (2018) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxx025> and hierarchical model developed by Lian, Hodges, and Chu (2019) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1476239> for performing meta-analysis for 1-5 diagnostic tests to simultaneously compare multiple tests within a missing data framework. This package evaluates the accuracy of multiple diagnostic tests and also gives graphical representation of the results.
